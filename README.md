# wViP
wViP (https://wvip.biocuckoo.cn/) is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement.

  Here, we developed an easy-to-use web service, word cloud visualization of biological profiles (wViP), to visualize the scientific literature into concise and intuitive word clouds for 4 distinct purposes, including but not limited to the research career summary, summarization of biological findings, highlighting scientific hotspots, and the research profile of a journal's publications. In addition, we also implemented an option for word cloud visualization of enrichment analyses in 12 species with 15 types of functional annotations, using funnel plot and treemap. Taken together, we anticipate that wViP will be a powerful online service to visualize various biological profiles with the word cloud from the scientific literature. The wViP will be continuously maintained and improved upon users' comments and feedbacks.

  The test data and scripts for this project are fully public.
