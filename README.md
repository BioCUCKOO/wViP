# wViP
wViP (https://wvip.biocuckoo.cn/) is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement.

  With the rapid progression of biological research, an expansive array of biological profiles in diverse topics with intricate perspectives has emerged. It is challenging for researchers to easily capture the hotspots from such massive literatures. Here, we provide an easy-to-use webserver, word cloud visualization of biological profiles (wViP), which aims to transfer the scientific text into a concise and inspiring word cloud based on the correlation among in-context words. Empowered with LLMs, we could further refine and visualize the association between the topic word(s) with related hotspots. We believe wVIP would provide user-friendly usage and intuitive experience towards insightful results.

  The test data and scripts for this project are fully public.
